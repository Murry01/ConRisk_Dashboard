    """
    **ConRisk Dashboard** app is a web-based application that can be used for the risk management of a construction project. 
    ConRisk Dashboard was built with the aid of **Streamlit** python library, and the database is powered by graph database 
    (GDB) developed in Neo4j using the cypher programming language. ConRisk Dashboard can be used as a quick reference for 
    risk identification, assessment, analysis, and planning mitigation of a new similar project. ConRisk Dashboard provides 
    a uniform platform for project stakeholders for shared understanding and holistic communication of the project risks. 
    Developing the ConRisk Dashboard is a step towards the digital transformation of RM processes, thereby saving cost and 
    time expended on expert workshops at the beginning of every project. ConRisk Dashboard would also help reduce over-reliance 
    on subjective/biased expert judgment so that informed decision-making can be made to ensure project success. 
    Further, this app can support the development of AI-based RM systems for construction projects.

    This app is part of an ongoing project to develop an Integrated AI-based Risk Management System for Construction Projects. 
    The current ConRisk Dashboard is developed using the construction risk register of an ongoing coastal project in Queensland, 
    Australia. Click the [link](https://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/coordinator-general/assessments-and-approvals/coordinated-projects/completed-projects/townsville-ocean-terminal)
    to learn more about the project. The current ConRisk Dashboard is limited to the risks identified in the risk register of the said project.
    Thus, the development of a similar dashboard to manage Tunnel and Bridge project risks is underway.
